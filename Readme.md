#This program will calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers
ALGORITHM

Step 1: declare an integer variable called n  , i and sum                                   
//*where n is the number , i is the maximum limit and sum is the sum of the square of the n*//
Step 2:initialize an integer var  called square  and assign it the value of n*n
Step 3:  prompt user to enter a the maximum limit of input i
Step 4: Receive input (value of i ) from keyboard
Step 5: Create a For loop where n=0, n<=i , n++
//* a loop to select and calculate squares of all numbers from 0 to i and display their sum*//
Step 6: calculate square of the  number n 
Step 7: increment the value of squares of all number up to i and assign the value to  sum
Step 8: print out the sum




PSEUDOCODE

START
	Int n,i, sum;                    //* n is the number, i is the max limit of numbers *//
	int square=n*n;
INPUT 
	Get i;
            
     FOR (n=0; input<=i; n ++)
       square= n*n;
       sum+=square; 

OUTPUT 
Print sum;
